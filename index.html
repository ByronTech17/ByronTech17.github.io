                <h1>Byron Springer</h1>
                <p>
                    Byron K. Springer is the Vice President of CoSup Gaming and
                    a PC member since 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Byron lives in the Black Forest and is in S5 in the English
                    section. Throughout his academic career, Byron has won
                    multiple awards. As a young leader, Byron has helped to
                    instill purpose in many, not only by way of his ability to
                    unite others, but also his collaborative energy. Championing
                    what is right for others comes easily to Byron and is
                    largely a result of his innate optimism and positive outlook
                    on life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That experience honed his belief in the power of uniting
                    ordinary people around a politics of purpose, in the hard
                    work of studentship, to bring about positive change. At
                    CoSup Gaming, he became the youngest vice-president.

                            In times of challenge and change, Byron’s help in
                            leadership ushered in a stronger school community, a
                            better school environment, and school more respected
                            around the European School system. The Byron years
                            so far were ones in which more students not only
                            began to see themselves in the changing face of the
                            European School of Karlsruhe, but to see the
                            European School of Karlsruhe the way he always has –
                            as the only school where so many of our stories
                            could even be possible.
