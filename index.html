            <p>
                Byron K. Springer is the Vice-President of CoSup Gaming and a PC
                member since 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
                Few students have walked a more improbable path to the European
                School of Karlsruhe. Born in Germany to a mother from South
                Africa and a father from Germany, Byron was raised together with
                three other siblings whose generosity of spirit reflected their
                South African and Asian roots. The homespun values they
                instilled in him, paired with his innate sense of optimism,
                compelled Byron to devote his life to giving every student,
                regardless of his or her background, the same chance the
                European School of Karlsruhe gave him.
            </p>

            <p>
                After working his way through school for 10 years with the help
                of his families support, Byron lives in the Black Forest, where
                he has won many awards and also has helped many different
                aspects of the European School system for students being
                developed. That experience honed his belief in the power of
                uniting ordinary people around a politics of purpose, in the
                hard work of studentship, to bring about positive change. At
                CoSup Gaming, he became the youngest vice-president.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since 2017, Byron has been actively involved in many different
                school projects and has been working on many different projects
                to boost students potential and productivity around the school.
            </p>

            <p>
                In times of challenge and change, Byron’s help in leadership
                ushered in a stronger school community, a better school
                environment, and school more respected around the European
                School system. The Byron years so far were ones in which more
                students not only began to see themselves in the changing face
                of the European School of Karlsruhe, but to see the European
                School of Karlsruhe the way he always has – as the only school
                where so many of our stories could even be possible.
